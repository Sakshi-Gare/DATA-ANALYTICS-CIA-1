                                                               ## SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR

### DESCRIPTION

    This project aims to create a graphical user interface (GUI) based scientific calculator using python programming.
    The scientific calculator performs various arithematic operations, trignometric functions, logarithmic functions, advanced functions and has scientific notations. There 
    are two menu bars for the users to choose from. The first menu bar has the options of a scientific calculator, a standard calculator and the option to exit for the 
    user.The other menu bar has the option to either edit, cut, copy and paste for the users. It also stores the history of the past calculations in an another file if the 
    users want to access the past calculations.

### FUNCTIONALITIES OF A SMART CALCULATOR

    Scientific calculator are designed to perform complex mathematical problems. The functionalities of our scientific calculator are listed below:
    
      1. Arithematic Operations: Scientific calculators not only perform advanced and complex problems but also the basic operations such as addition, subtraction, 
                                 multiplication, division and percentage.
                                 
      2. Trigonometric Operations: Our calculator performs a few trigonometric functions such as cos(θ), tan(θ) and sin(θ).
      
      3. Advanced Operations: The calculator can perform advanced operations on complex mathematical problems like square root, powers, exponential, factorial and 
                              permutation.
                              
      4. Logarithmic Operation: It can also perform logarithmic function as natural log and log base 10 is also available in the calculator.

### HOW TO RUN THE CODE

     1. 
      
### PRE- REQUISITES

    For us to create this scientific calculator, we were required to import certain packages and libraries for the calculator to get an interface, display the buttons of 
    all the  mathematical functions, run the operations and get the result.
    
     1. Python- The programming language of python is to be installed in order to create this scientific calculator. Pyhton can be installed from its official website.
     
     2. TKinter- It is a GUI( Graphical User Interface) toolkit which has the neccessary packages and libraries for the calculator to display, since this smart calculator 
                 is a GUI based calculator. TKinter can be installed from pip.

     3. Math- Math library is also imported to perform all the mathematical functions in the calculator. 

     4. Menu- Menu library is used to easily create command lines for menu. Since we have displayed menu bar in  our calculator we have imported it.
                 
     3. A code editor- Python code editor is required to type, edit and run the codes for the calculator. For instance Google Colaboratory, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter 
                       Notebook or any other editor can be used.
